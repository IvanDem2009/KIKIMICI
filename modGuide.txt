Nuclear Rampage is a mod for fighting in multiplayer. 
Currently, there are two modes: 

Duel
Two teams choose their fightning units and try to destroy each other`s cores. 
I am making maps for this mode right now. 

How to make maps for duels:
Size: 200x100 (width = 200, height = 100)
Cores: place two main cores in the center and two secondary cores on the edges
Spawners: place 1-2 spawners on the bottom of map, add item source. Place starting plates near the spawn.
Environment: place environment walls on the edge of map and normal walls in the middle. I recommend you to place floors under objectives: then you can easily mirror the map

Play it on PvP mode


4/4
There are four teams. Each team has one core at the start. Also, there are two derelict cores near each base. 
If you break the core - it changes color to your team. Goal: destroy all cores

How to make maps for 4/4: 
Size: 250x250 (width = 250, height = 250)
Cores: place main core at the middle line and two derelict secondary cores near main core.
Spawner: place a spawner with an item source next to the core
Environment: the only rule - use environment blocks that are in the mod

Play it on PvP mode

Also, I am making a processor that will hit the cores every ** seconds.
